Hopkins staff conducted weekly sampling (more or less) continuously from March 1951 through June 1974. Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) took over the Monterey Bay sampling program in July 1974, and it appears to have ended in 1979. The aim of the initial program was to conduct joint fisheries-oceanographic cruises that would help researchers understand what contributed to the crash of the California sardine fishery. The Hopkins Marine Station CalCOFI dataset is an extremely important contribution to early oceanographic research in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, and extends our observations in this area decades into the past. The raw and aggregated data for most of these cruises currently resides in the library at the Hopkins Marine Station. \n\nThis portion of the dataset is a transcription of the zooplankton data that was collected from 1955 to 1963 (a subset of the full HMS CalCOFI program).

Marine birds \nand mammals were observed in a 90-degree arc from the bow to one side of the ship out to 300m. Counts are summarized by species and behavior along the transects in 3 km bins. Data span years 1987 - 2006.\n\nPurpose:\nRelating changing ocean productivity patterns and upper-trophic predator (seabirds and marine mammals) distributions to the underlying physical oceanographic variability enhances our understanding of the ecological context of the CalCOFI and NMFS database, thereby aiding in the interpretation of large-scale hydrographic and ocean productivity patterns. An inter-disciplinary, ecosystem-level perspective will provide new insight into offshore California wildlife habitat associations and how apex marine organisms (including fish with diets similar to seabirds and/or mammals) respond to differences in ocean climate, productivity, and water mass properties, information needed to manage fisheries and wildlife under changing ocean conditions.\n\nSupplemental information:\n[2020-09-30] The following invalid species names were corrected according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS).\nBlack-footed Albatross: Diomedea nigripes (174516) =&gt; Phoebastria nigripes (554379)\nBonaparte's Gull: Larus philadelphia (176839) =&gt; Chroicocephalus philadelphia (824040)\nCaspian Tern: Sterna caspia (176924) =&gt; Hydroprogne caspia (176935)\nElegant Tern: Sterna elegans (176925) =&gt; Thalasseus elegans (176931)\nFranklin's Gull: Larus pipixcan (176838) =&gt; Leucophaeus pipixcan (824082)\nGreat Egret: Casmerodius albus (174810) =&gt; Ardea alba (554135)\nLaughing Gull: Larus atricilla (176837) =&gt; Leucophaeus atricilla (824079)\nLaysan Albatross: Diomedea immutabilis (174517) =&gt; Phoebastria immutabilis (554378)\nLeast Tern: Sterna antillarum (176923) =&gt; Sternula antillarum (824127)\nRed Phalarope: Phalaropus fulicaria (554376) =&gt; Phalaropus fulicarius (176734)\nRoyal Tern: Sterna maxima (176922) =&gt; Thalasseus maximus (824142)\nSouth Polar Skua: Catharacta maccormicki (176801) =&gt; Stercorarius maccormicki (660062)\nWillet: Catoptrophorus semipalmatus (176638) =&gt; Tringa semipalmata (824147)\nParula americana (178868) =&gt; Setophaga americana (950033)\nDendroica petechia T(178878) =&gt; Setophaga petechia (950039)\nDendroica townsendi (178897) =&gt; Setophaga townsendi (950058)\nDendroica occidentalis (178902) =&gt; Setophaga occidentalis (950059)\nDendroica coronata (178891) =&gt; Setophaga coronata (950046)\nWilsonia pusilla (178973) =&gt; Cardellina pusilla (950080)\n\n[UPDATE 2013-03-25] The following species codes had been associated with invalid species names.

Observers used handheld 7X50 reticle Fujinon binoculars to sight, identify, and make school size estimates of cetaceans and pinnipeds encountered along the transect lines between CalCOFI water sampling stations. The southern water sampling stations are set along six, parallel lines running southwest to northeast, with lines increasing in length from north to south (470 – 700 km) and stations occurring every 37 km in coastal and continental shelf waters and every 74 km offshore. Three research vessels were used for the sixteen surveys, Scripps Institution of Oceanography Roger Revelle (2 surveys) and New Horizon (8 surveys) and, NOAA David Starr Jordan (6 surveys), vessel height varied from 8.1-13.2m and survey speed varied from 10 to 12 knots.\n\nPurpose:\nThe waters off southern California are remarkably diverse and species rich, but they are also an area of swift commercial development, navy training activity, population growth and climate change. Continued visual marine mammal and seabird surveys working in concert with oceanographic ecosystem investigations are essential for monitoring the health and changes of the California current system.\n\nSupplemental information:\nEffort tracklines, two Delphinus delphis sightings in 2005 and one in 2006, overlap with data published in the CalCOFI and NMFS Seabird and Marine Mammal Observation Data, 1987-2006 dataset.

The Oceanographic Station Data format contains physical-chemical oceanographic data recorded at discrete depth levels. Most of the observations were made using multi-bottle Nansen casts or other types of water samplers. A small amount (about 5 percent) were obtained using electronic CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) or STD (salinity- temperature-depth) recorders. The CTD/STD data were reported to NODC at depth levels equivalent to Nansen cast data, however, and have been processed and stored the same as the Nansen data.

The principal measured parameters and temperature and salinity , but dissolved oxygen, phosphate, total phosphorus, silicate, nitrate, nitrite, and pH may be reported. Meteorological conditions at the time of the cast (e.g., air temperature and pressure, wind, waves) may also be reported, as well as auxiliary data such as water color (Forel-Ule scale), water transparency (Secchi disk depth), and depth to bottom. Values of density (sigma-t) sound velocity, and dynamic depth anomaly are computed from measured parameters.

PaCOOS cruises generally subsample the standard California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) grid of hydrographic stations. This PaCOOS cruise did exactly that, sampling along CalCOFI line 67 from Moss Landing, California, to station 90 (CTD casts 1-19). To increase the resolution of the hydrographic data and to maintain the convention of similar recent PaCOOS cruises, eight CTD casts were also inserted between the standard CalCOFI sites along line 67. Participants on the cruise came from the Naval Postgraduate School (Physical Oceanography, Nutrient Analysis), the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (Nutrient Analysis, Primary Productivity), University of California at Santa Cruz (Zooplankton Analysis), and Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (Nutrient Analysis).","Chemical, physical, and zooplankton abundance/biomass data were collected using secchi disk, zooplankton net, current meter (ADCP), bottle, and CTD casts in the Coastal Waters of California from the NEW HORIZON and DAVID STARR JORDAN.

Here we synthesize remotely sensed, hydrographic, and biological survey data from throughout the CCS in 2019–2020 to evaluate how recent changes in environmental conditions have affected community dynamics at multiple trophic levels. A marine heatwave formed in the north Pacific in 2019 and reached the second greatest area ever recorded by the end of summer 2020. However, high atmospheric pressure in early 2020 drove relatively strong Ekman-driven coastal upwelling in the northern portion of the CCS and warm temperature anomalies remained far offshore. Upwelling and cooler temperatures in the northern CCS created relatively productive conditions in which the biomass of lipid-rich copepod species increased, adult krill size increased, and several seabird species experienced positive reproductive success. Despite these conditions, the composition of the fish community in the northern CCS remained a mixture of both warm- and cool-water-associated species. In the southern CCS, ocean temperatures remained above average for the seventh consecutive year. Abundances of juvenile fish species associated with productive conditions were relatively low, and the ichthyoplankton community was dominated by a mixture of oceanic warm-water and cosmopolitan species. Seabird species associated with warm water also occurred at greater densities than cool-water species in the southern CCS. The population of northern anchovy, which has been resurgent since 2017, continued to provide an important forage base for piscivorous fishes, offshore colonies of seabirds, and marine mammals throughout the CCS. Coastal upwelling in the north, and a longer-term trend in warming in the south, appeared to be controlling the community to a much greater extent than the marine heatwave itself.","The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters \n(Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and \nDr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) \nto support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. \nThe project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility \nand use of long-term data.

The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) are a unique partnership of the California Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries Service and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The organization was formed in 1949 to study the ecological aspects of the sardine population collapse off California.

Cruise and station information may include environmental conditions of the study site at the time of observation. Data are very sparse prior to 1951.","Chlorophyll A and Phaeophytin A data collected by various ships in Monterey Bay, California. The data were collected from June 19, 1971 to June 15, 1977 as part of California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations (CALCOFI) project. The original data were recorded in ASCII and submitted on an unlabeled 9-track 1600 BPI magnetic tape. The documentation includes a record format description and title pages of technical reports associated with this investigation. Principal Investigator was Dr. Mary Silver. The study was carried out by University of California at Santa Cruz, Monterey Bay, California.","Chemical, physical, and other data were collected from NOAA Ship DAVID STARR JORDAN from June 08, 1975 to June 11, 1975. Data were collected using meteorological sensors, Secchi disk, and bottle casts. Data were submitted by Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) as part of the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigation (CALCOFI) project.","This accession contains zooplankton biomass displacement volumes sampled using zooplankton nets on various platforms in the North Pacific Ocean from 1951-01-10 to 2015-05-01, as part of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI). The accession contains biomass data in long and short format as it is available in the COPEPOD program. The accession also includes the HTML files for the user to reconstruct the COPEPOD environment and search for data by platform, project, investigator, cruise and taxa. Data from this program have supported numerous analyses documenting the seasonal and inter-annual variability in the distribution and abundance of the zooplankton taxa in the North Pacific.","2009 Winter CalCOFI. CalCOFI 75 Sta PatternThe California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) are a unique partnership of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries Service and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The organization was formed in 1949 to study the ecological aspects of the sardine population collapse off California. Today our focus has shifted to the study of the marine environment off the coast of California, the management of its living resources, and monitoring the indicators of El Nino and climate change. CalCOFI conducts quarterly cruises off southern and central California, collecting a suite of hydrographic and biological data on station and underway. Data collected at depths down to 500 m include: temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite, chlorophyll, transmissometer, PAR, C14 primary productivity, phytoplankton biodiversity, zooplankton biomass, and zooplankton biodiversity."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>li<\/th>\n      <th>docid<\/th>\n      <th>url<\/th>\n      <th>title<\/th>\n      <th>more_versions<\/th>\n      <th>related_article<\/th>\n      <th>explore_at<\/th>\n      <th>explore_at_n<\/th>\n      <th>download_formats<\/th>\n      <th>download_formats_n<\/th>\n      <th>dataset_updated<\/th>\n      <th>dataset_provided_by<\/th>\n      <th>time_period_covered<\/th>\n      <th>area_covered<\/th>\n      <th>authors<\/th>\n      <th>description<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[1,8,10]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"li","targets":1},{"name":"docid","targets":2},{"name":"url","targets":3},{"name":"title","targets":4},{"name":"more_versions","targets":5},{"name":"related_article","targets":6},{"name":"explore_at","targets":7},{"name":"explore_at_n","targets":8},{"name":"download_formats","targets":9},{"name":"download_formats_n","targets":10},{"name":"dataset_updated","targets":11},{"name":"dataset_provided_by","targets":12},{"name":"time_period_covered","targets":13},{"name":"area_covered","targets":14},{"name":"authors","targets":15},{"name":"description","targets":16}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
