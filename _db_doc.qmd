Google Drive \*.csv files get ingested with a **workflow** per **dataset** (in Github repository [calcofi/workflows](https://github.com/calcofi/workflows) as a Quarto document). Data definition CSV files (`tbls_rename.csv` , `flds_rename.csv`) are auto-generated (if missing) and manually updated to rename and describe tables and fields. After injecting the data for each of the tables, extra metadata is added to the `COMMENT`s of each table as JSON elements (links in markdown), including at the ***table*** level:

-   **description**: general description describing contents and how each row is unique
-   **source**: CSV (linked to Google Drive source as markdown)
-   **source_created**: datetime stamp of when source was created on GoogleDrive
-   **workflow**: html (rendered Quarto document on Github)
-   **workflow_ingested**: datetime of ingestion

And at the ***field*** level:

-   **description**: general description of the field
-   **units**: using the International System of Units (SI) as much as possible

These comments are then exposed by the API [db_tables](https://api.calcofi.io/db_tables) endpoint, which can be consumed and rendered into a tabular searchable catalog with [calcofi4r::cc_db_catalog](https://calcofi.io/calcofi4r/reference/cc_db_catalog.html).

Additional workflows will publish the data to the various [Portals](https://calcofi.io/docs/portals.html) (ERDDAP, EDI, OBIS, NCEI) using ecological metadata language (EML) and the [EML](https://docs.ropensci.org/EML/) R package, pulling directly from the structured metadata in the database (on table and field definitions).
