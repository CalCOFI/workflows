## 2025-07-01.b + data_integrity_checkpoint

In @workflows/ingest_swfsc.noaa.gov_calcofi-db.qmd, add a new chunk after 
"check_mismatched_tables_fields" that prevents the rest of the script from 
running and explains with a header and message that the changes need to be
resolved before proceeding. This is to ensure that the script does not run
when there are mismatched tables or fields, which could lead to data integrity
issues.

### Claude Response

I've successfully added a new chunk called "stop_if_mismatches" that:

  1. Checks for mismatches - If any changes were detected between CSV files and redefinitions
  2. Displays a clear warning box - Shows a formatted message explaining the issue
  3. Provides guidance - Lists the redefinition files that need to be updated and common resolution steps
  4. Halts execution - Uses stop() to prevent the workflow from continuing when there are mismatches
  5. Shows success message - If no mismatches are found, displays a confirmation message

  This ensures data integrity by preventing the database ingestion process from running when there are unresolved differences between the
  CSV files and their redefinition metadata.
  
### Prompt #2 

That's the right idea, except I want to allow the Quarto markdown notebook to 
finish rendering, so use a different approach that prevents the rest of the code 
chunks from being evaluated, ie with `knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)`, and 
output with prettier markdown (including a header) using `#| output: asis`. And 
if there are no messages then it should similarly allow evaluation, and use 
markdown to say something to the effect that the rest of the workflow is allowed 
to proceed past this checkpoint.    


### Claude Response #2

⏺ Perfect! I've updated the data integrity checkpoint to:

  1. Use #| output: asis to output raw markdown instead of code output
  2. Use knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE) to disable evaluation of remaining chunks when mismatches are found
  3. Output prettier markdown with proper headers, bullet points, and formatting
  4. Show success path when no mismatches are found, explicitly setting eval = TRUE and describing the workflow steps that will proceed

  The checkpoint now:
  - Allows the Quarto document to finish rendering even when there are mismatches
  - Provides clear, well-formatted markdown output explaining the situation
  - Prevents database operations from running when data integrity issues exist
  - Gives users actionable guidance on how to resolve the issues


### Prompt #3

Great! Now convert individual lines of cat() to multiline glue() for ease of reading/editing


### Claude Response

⏺ Perfect! I've converted the multiple cat() calls to use multiline glue() strings. This makes the code much more readable and easier to
  edit. The benefits include:

  1. Better readability - The markdown structure is now visually apparent in the code
  2. Easier editing - You can modify the text without dealing with multiple function calls
  3. Variable interpolation - The {d$paths$tbls_rd_csv} syntax is cleaner than string concatenation
  4. Maintains formatting - The indentation and line breaks are preserved in the output

  The multiline strings use glue() to interpolate the file paths directly into the markdown text, making it much cleaner than the previous
  approach with multiple cat() calls.
