<p>So the most recent larval data with attributable space and time is: - 1999-12-06 20:32:00 (longitude: -117.848333; latitude: 29.118333)</p>
<p>We’re clearly mismatching something since the most recent date for the ERDDAP subset is <code>2020-01-18T04:57:00Z</code>:</p>

<p>Marina:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I’ve uploaded some new tables into Postgres, containing the updated data that Ed had sent me earlier. Some tables are meant to replace existing ones, and have names ending with _new (e.g.&nbsp;larvae_counts_new, scrippscasts_new). There are also tables called ships, cruises and nets. The hierarchy is:</p>
<p>cruise -&gt; station -&gt; tow -&gt; net -&gt; eggs/larvae</p>
<p>The species_codes_new table has some entries missing in the taxon_rank column, I’ll fill them in ASAP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions: - [ ] How does <code>scrippscasts_new</code> fit into above scheme (cruise -&gt; station -&gt; tow -&gt; net -&gt; eggs/larvae)?</p>
