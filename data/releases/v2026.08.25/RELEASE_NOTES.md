# CalCOFI integrated database release v2026.08.25

**Release date:** 2026-08-25

## A quality flag now reaches every consumer, not just the database

Ralf Goericke reported a 2.18 ml/L oxygen spike at 1,144 m on station 080.0 160.0 in the
station data finder. The value is real and *was already flagged*: bottle 198640 of cast 7644
(cruise 5508BD, R/V Black Douglas, 3 Sep 1955) carries `O_qual = 8` (suspect) in the CalCOFI
Bottle Database. Two gaps let it through. The registry mapped `o_qual` onto `oxygen_ml_l` and
`oxygen_saturation` but not `oxygen_umol_kg` — the form the app plots — so the flag was dropped at
ingest; and no consumer filtered on `measurement_qual` at all.

- `oxygen_umol_kg` now carries `o_qual`; the CTD unit-conversion siblings (`oxygen_umol_kg_1/2`,
  `oxygen_saturation_1/2`, `potential_temperature_1/2`) carry their sensor's `ox1q`/`ox2q`/
  `temp1q`/`temp2q`. The bottle ingest writes `8`, not `8.0`, like the CTD ingest.
- The pre-QC `r_*` bottle types deliberately stay unflagged (Q09 to the provider): code 6 "OK but
  taken from CTD" describes a substitution made *during* QC and would mislabel ~36k rows.
- **Consumers:** one NULL-safe predicate per language — `calcofi4r::cc_qual_ok_sql()` (1.9.0),
  `calcofi4py.qual_ok_sql()` (0.3.7), db-query `qualOkSQL()` — applied in db-viz-station,
  db-viz-hex, ctd-transects, ctd-viz, db-query and the calcofi4r matchers/transects. On this
  release it excludes 35,587 bottle, 6,138 CTD and 51 DIC rows. Flagged values remain in the
  database with their codes; nothing is deleted.

## `cruise_key` is the cruise's designated month, resolved by date span

`YYYY-MM` in `cruise_key` was each cast's or tow's *own* calendar month. A CalCOFI cruise
routinely straddles a month boundary (5508BD ran 7 Aug – 25 Sep 1955; 184 of the 664 bottle
cruises span two months) and the neighbouring month is usually a real cruise of the same ship,
so the shorn-off casts landed on the wrong cruise with no FK ever failing: v2026.08.14 released 664
source bottle cruises as **799** keys, with 5,941 of 35,644 casts on a key their own source
disagrees with. Seven other ingests keyed tows the same way.

- The ichthyo ingest stamps every reference cruise's observed `date_min`/`date_max` (new columns on
  `cruise`); every other ingest resolves span containment first (same ship, ± 3 d — no two cruises
  of one ship overlap), then the source's own designation (bottle `Cruise` = YYYYMM), then the
  event month. Bottle: 799 → **657** keys; 5508BD is 34 casts and 5509BD 22, as in the source.
- The reference wins when sources disagree on a designation (ichthyo calls the 9 Feb – 29 Mar 1984
  Jordan cruise 8403, the bottle database 8402); the bottle notebook reports those cases.
- Second-order bug fixed on the way: the bottle CSV reader typed the all-digit `Cruise` column as
  DOUBLE (`'195508.0'`), which silently defeated the designation step on the first attempt.

## Depth is a coordinate, and it is now bounded

The previous release contained a CTD "cast" with scans at **14,671 m** over a 101 m seafloor — a
fluorometer test dip (`0010_001d`) from the `db-csvs/orig/` folder of the 2000-10 New Horizon
archive, which the tier classifier matched by substring. Its 17,964 dbar `pressure` value had been
deleted by the declared bound; the depth derived from it had not, because bounds apply to values,
not coordinates.

- `sample.seafloor_depth_m` (new column): bilinear GEBCO 2025 depth at every sample position
  (positive down, 0 on land, NULL outside the raster — 99.5 % of samples have one).
- Release gates: a depth beyond 6,500 m (the `pressure` ceiling) or NaN/negative fails the
  release (0 violations); samples deeper than the deepest GEBCO cell within one cell of their
  position + 10 m are reported and ratcheted (`DEPTH_SEAFLOOR_OVER_MAX = 694`, only ever down) —
  all but the test cast are 1949–1975 casts and tows on slopes and canyons with minute-rounded
  positions, so the measurement is fine and the place is imprecise. Never deleted.
- The CTD ingest excludes superseded `orig*`/`uncorrected/` exports (every cast in them is also in
  the top-level file, except that test dip) but keeps `separate_runs/` (20-1104SH's casts 031–036
  exist nowhere else).

## Two calcofi.org archives arrived with casts nobody can place

The 19-9604JD and 19-9608NH FinalQC archives, fetched from calcofi.org for the first time, carry
9,225 "RATHBURN CORE STN" scans with `-99` positions and the station *name* in the line/station
columns. They cannot enter `sample`/`obs`; the ingest now lists and drops them under a 0.2 %
ratchet instead of failing (Q27 asks whether coordinates exist). R's default 60 s download timeout,
which truncated every ~30 MB calcofi.org fetch at 15–25 MB, is now one hour.

**Packages:** calcofi4db 3.20.1, calcofi4r 1.9.0, calcofi4py 0.3.7. **Consumers rebuilt:**
db-viz-station, ctd-transects (both had a broken DuckDB installer step, `| sh` → `| bash`),
db-viz-hex, h3t API, db-viz-cruise, ERDDAP, db-query, ctd-qaqc, and ctd-viz — whose `prep_db.R`
had needed the retired `ctd_cast`/`ctd_thin`/`ctd_summary` parquet since the core consolidation
and had served a 2026-05-15 database for three releases; it now builds from `sample`/`obs`.
**Open:** ERDDAP `flag_values`/`flag_meanings` on `measurement_qual`; netCDF `*_qc` companions.
