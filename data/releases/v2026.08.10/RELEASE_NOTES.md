# CalCOFI integrated database release v2026.08.10

**Release date:** 2026-08-10

## Ten CTD cruises are back

v2026.08.08 lost every observation of ten cruises while keeping their casts, and no FK check could
see it: the CTD ingest extracted archives into a Google Drive folder, Drive evicted files to
cloud-only placeholders mid-sync, and `read_csv()` returned a 0-row tibble with no error — while
the Drive-minted ` 2.csv` conflict copies broke the cast-direction parse. `check_cruise_coverage()`
(calcofi4db 3.12.0) now fails a release on a cruise that leaves `obs` but keeps its casts; 142
cruises restored (`obs_ctd_full` +13.7 M rows).

## METS longitudes have their sign

The unsigned `Longitude_W` was released as positive (125.8 °W read as 124.9 °E in the measured
coverage); it is negated, answering mets_20. The orphan-cruise ratchet tightened 5 → 1.

## The pipeline stops invalidating itself

`release_database` had declared the whole `data/releases` directory as its output, so
`test_release` writing `test_results.json` beside it made the release permanently outdated and
every later `tar_make()` re-froze and re-uploaded an already-promoted release. It now declares a
deterministic `_release_stamp.json`; `check_nested_outputs()` refuses any directory output.

**Packages:** calcofi4db 3.12.0, 3.13.0; calcofi4r 1.6.0 (seafloor sampled along the transect
track, not at stations).
