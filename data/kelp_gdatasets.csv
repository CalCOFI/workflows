 contributions of biological and environmental variables in explaining
 observed spatial and temporal patterns. For this purpose, the
 ecological community and physical structure of kelp forest ecosystems
 have been surveyed using trained SCUBA divers. The biological
 structure includes the more conspicuous fishes, invertebrates, and
 macroalgae. The physical structure includes geomorphological
 attributes (substratum type and vertical relief). Among other
 applications, these surveys have informed the design and evaluation of
 the state-wide network of marine protected areas (MPAs) established by
 California’s Marine Life Protection Act. Over time, the role of the
 monitoring program for evaluating the ecological responses to the
 establishment of the MPAs greatly influenced both the spatial and

These experiments were used to tease apart the effects of seasonal variation in light availability and nutrients on the response of three high-latitude kelp species (Macrocystis pyrifera, Hedophyllum nigripes, and Neoagarum fimbriatum) to pH and temperature. Experimental controls were designed to approximate current environmental conditions in Sitka Sound, and treatments were based on projected end-of-century scenarios of ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) for this region. At the end of the experiments, the investigators assessed the seasonal impact of OW and OA on kelp growth rates, thallus nitrogen content, and carbon acquisition strategy based on thallus δ13C values. Finally, to test whether kelp palatability was impacted by future warming and acidification, tissue of H. nigripes and N. fimbriatum grown during the experiments was used to perform feeding assays with a common kelp forest consumer. 

These experiments were performed to improve our understanding of how global change will alter marine primary producer resources by integrating natural variation in environmental drivers.

Bull kelp (Nereocystis leutkeana) and giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) are important canopy-forming kelp species found in marine nearshore habitats on the West coast of Canada. Often referred to as a foundation species, beds of kelp form structural underwater forests that offer habitat for fishes and invertebrates. Despite its far-ranging importance, kelp has experienced a decline in the west coast of North America. The losses have been in response to direct harvest, increase in herbivores through the removal of predators by fisheries or diseases, increase in water turbidity from shoreline development as well as sea temperature change, ocean acidification, and increased storm activates. Understanding these impacts and the level of resilience of different kelp populations requires spatiotemporal baselines of kelp distribution. The area covered by this dataset includes the BC coast and extends to portions of the Washington and Alaska coasts. This dataset was created using 137 British Admiralty (BA) charts, including insets, with scales ranging from 1:6,080 to 1:500,000, created between 1858 and 1956. All surveys were based on triangulation, in which a sextant or theodolite was used to determine latitude and angles, while a chronometer was used to help determine longitude. First, each BA chart was scanned by the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) using the CHS Colortrac large format scanner, and saved as a Tagged Image Format at 200 DPI, which was deemed sufficient resolution to properly visualize all the features of interest. Subsequently, the scanned charts were imported into ESRI ArcMap and georeferenced directly to WGS84 using CHS georeferencing standards and principles (charts.gc.ca). In order to minimize error, a hierarchy of control points was used, ranging from high survey order control points to comparing conspicuous stable rock features apparent in satellite imagery. The georeferencing result was further validated against satellite imagery, CHS charts and fieldsheets, the CHS-Pacific High Water Line (charts.gc.ca), and adjacent and overlapping BA charts. Finally, the kelp features were digitized, and corresponding chart information (scale, chart number, title, survey start year, survey end year, and comments) was added as attributes to each feature. Given the observed differences in kelp feature representation at different scales, when digitizing kelp features, polygons were used to represent the discrete observations, and as such, they represent presence of kelp and not kelp area. Polygons were created by tracing around the kelp feature, aiming to keep the outline close to the stipe and blades. The accuracy of the location of the digitized kelp features was defined using a reliability criterion, which considers the location of the digitized kelp feature (polygon) in relation to the local depth in which the feature occurs. For this, we defined a depth threshold of 40 m to represent a low likelihood of kelp habitat in areas deeper than the threshold. An accuracy assessment of the digitized kelp features concluded that 99% of the kelp features occurred in expected areas within a depth of less than 40 m, and only about 1% of the features occurred completely outside of this depth."

However, little is known about the impact of kelp forests on iodine speciation in coastal sea water. To address this, we examined iodide and iodate concentrations in seawater in and around a giant kelp forest near San Diego, CA, USA, and a nearby site that was not influenced by kelp biology. Our data shows that while both iodide and iodate concentrations remained unchanged during the year at the nearby site, these concentrations changed significantly in and around the kelp forest, and were strongly related to changes in kelp canopy biomass. In particular, iodide reached its highest concentration and iodate reached its lowest concentration during the summer when the kelp canopies were near their maximum, while the opposite pattern was observed during the winter and spring when the kelp canopies were near their minimum. Further, comparisons of these changes with corresponding changes in seawater temperature and wind speed indicated that these relationships were relatively small compared to those with changes in kelp biomass. Together, our data show a strong relationship between kelp biomass and iodine metabolism."

These data describe the abundance and size of fish species as part
of SBCLTER's kelp forest monitoring program to track long-term
patterns in species abundance and diversity. This study began in
2000 in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA. The abundance
and size of all taxa of resident kelp forest fish encountered along
permanent transects are recorded at nine reef sites located along
the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel and at two sites on
the north side of Santa Cruz Island. These sites reflect several
oceanographic regimes in the channel and vary in distance from
sources of terrestrial runoff. In these surveys, fish were counted
in either a 40x2m benthic quadrat, or in the water parcel 0-2m off
the bottom over the same area.


The two tables in this data package include: 1) The annual benthic
fish community survey which was conducted on 11 reefs once a year
around late July or early August; and 2) The monthly fish survey
which was conducted once a month at a subset of the sites (3 of the
annual sites)


The time period of data collection for the annual benthic fish
community survey varied among the 11 kelp forest sites. Sampling at
BULL, CARP, and NAPL began in 2000, sampling at the other 6 mainland
sites (AHND, AQUE, IVEE, GOLB, ABUR, MOHK) began in 2001 (transects
3, 5, 6, 7, 8 at IVEE were added in 2011). Data collection at the
two Santa Cruz Island sites (SCTW and SCDI) began in 2004. The
monthly fish survey at ABUR (Transect 1, 2, and 3), AQUE
(Transect1), and MOHK (Transect 1) in 2002. The Transect 2 and 3 at
ABUR were discontinued in June 2006.


See Methods for more information. 

 The primary research objective of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER is to investigate
    the importance of land and ocean processes in structuring giant kelp
     (Macrocystis pyrifera ) forest ecosystems. As in many temperate
    regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated
    by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are
    influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open
    ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and
    processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and
    pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs.
    Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary
    production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic
    interactions of kelp forest ecosystems."

This vector dataset is a thematic map representing mosaicked multi-spectral imagery, targeting both exposed and submerged kelp beds along the California coastline and Channel Islands. The imagery used to create this classification was acquired at a spatial resolution of 0.3 meters using a Microsoft UltraCam Eagle digital camera acquiring in the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands. The image mosaic product used for the classification is a result of the resampling of the 0.3 meter data to 2 meter resolution. The data are projected in California Teale Albers using North American Datum 1983. Surface kelp canopy and subsurface kelp classifications are separate. The data was collected and processed by Sandoval & Associates, LLC under contract by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). CDFW must be credited with the distribution of these data. The imagery was collected September 3-25, 2016. This dataset is complete at this time, although the user should note any omissions. DISCLAIMER The user is cautioned against making direct comparisons between the various kelp surveys for the following reasons: (1)Timing of the survey is important, particularly with respect to growing season, conditions in the ocean, storms, and harvest levels preceding the dates of imagery collection. Season variability may account for differences in surveys which may not reflect a change in the bed's extent, productivity, or harvest level. (2) Statisical significance in change of area should be evaluated. To do this, a variance parameter is needed, which is obtained by repeated measurements. (3) Survey methods may not be consistent. Some method of calibration between the methods should be performed in order to insure a change of area is not due to survey instrumentation and not misinterpreted as a biological change. (4) An area where no kelp data are present may represent an area devoid of kelp, or may represent an area where kelp was not detected due to poor photo quality, missing photo coverage, or other issues with data collection and processing. Image coverage is extensive for the state, but the user is advised to consult the supplementary information for each year to determine whether imagery were acquired for an area of interest.This version is resampled to 5m cell grid from source vectors.

  monitoring phases of California’s statewide Marine Protection Area
  implementation and evaluation process. These datasets include the
  baseline periods for all regions, and additional historical data.
  The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans
  (PISCO) kelp forest program, administered out of the University of
  California campuses in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara and funded
  primarily by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, has been
  monitoring across California since 1999, and with a focus on Marine
  Protected Areas. The Vantuna Research Group at Occidental College
  has conducted monitoring in the southern California region since
  1966, and has been using similar sampling methods to the PISCO
  program to monitor kelp forests in the region since the 2004
  wide-scale monitoring effort of the Cooperative Research and
  Assessment of Nearshore Ecosystems (CRANE) Program. Researchers at
  Humboldt State University began monitoring sites in the north coast
  region in 2014 and 2015 using the PISCO sampling methodology. Data
  have been integrated across all four programs. To comprehensively and quantitatively characterize the ecological
  community and geological features at each kelp forest site, four different sampling methods
  are employed, all of which are conducted visually by SCUBA divers.
  Fish transects and benthic macroalgae and invertebrate transects
  overlap with, but are spatially distinct from one another. Surveys
  are conducted annually, during the summer or early fall. Typically,
  two to four sites inside a given MPA and two to four sites outside
  of the MPA are surveyed in a given year, with the number and shape
  of sites varying depending on habitat (e.g. onshore-offshore
  steepness of the reef) and longshore width of the MPA. Sampling
  history varies by program, MPA, and sampling site."

This event was expected to have a devastating impact on populations of giant kelp, an important coastal foundation species found in cool, nutrient rich waters. To evaluate this expectation, we used a time series of satellite imagery to examine giant kelp canopy biomass before, during, and after this heatwave across more than 7 degrees of latitude in southern and Baja California. We examined spatial patterns in resistance, i.e., the initial response of kelp, and resilience, i.e., the abundance of kelp 2 years after the heatwave ended. The heatwave had a large and immediate negative impact on giant kelp near its southern range limit in Baja. In contrast, the impacts of the heatwave were delayed throughout much of the central portion of our study area, while the northern portions of our study area exhibited high levels of resistance and resilience to the warming, despite large positive temperature anomalies. Giant kelp resistance throughout the entire region was most strongly correlated with the mean temperature of the warmest month of the heatwave, indicating that the loss of canopy was more sensitive to exceeding an absolute temperature threshold than to the magnitude of relative changes in temperature. Resilience was spatially variable and not significantly related to SST metrics or to resistance, indicating that local scale environmental and biotic processes played a larger role in determining the recovery of kelp from this extreme warming event. Our results highlight the resilient nature of giant kelp, but also point to absolute temperature thresholds that are associated with rapid loss of kelp forests."

There are 549 free-living life-stages (comprising 492 species from 21 Phyla) and 549 parasitic life-stages (comprising 450 species from 10 Phyla). Links represent three kinds of trophic interactions. There are 9,352 predator-prey links, 2,733 parasite-host links and 9,871 predator-parasite links. This food web is unique in that all decisions for including nodes and links are documented, and extensive metadata in the node list allows users to filter the node list to suit their research questions. The kelp-forest food web is more species rich than any other published food web with parasites, and has a larger proportion of parasitic species than other webs. Because we have organized the food web topologically, its use may be somewhat limited in the opportunity to detect adaptation, realized as changes in link weights. Our food web may be used to predict how kelp forests may respond to change, will advance our understanding of parasites in ecosystems, and fosters development of food-web theory that incorporates large networks.

Kelp forests support a range of species such as red abalone and red sea urchins which form the basis for important invertebrate fisheries in the region. Along with fisheries, kelp forests provide a suite of other ecosystem services including supporting biodiversity and carbon sequestration, making them critical habitats to monitor. Monitoring of kelps and kelp obligate species is now more important than ever with the intensification of ocean changes such as marine heatwaves, low oxygen events and ocean acidification. Changes in kelp forest ecosystems associated with fishing can be observed inside fished sites whereas changes in protected sites suggests region wide stressors. In this long-term, bull kelp forest monitoring program, divers quantify key marine invertebrates, algal cover and substrate types along transects inside and outside fished sites centered in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, in northern California. As nearshore kelp forest ecosystems face increasing stressors, long term monitoring programs will be critical for informing fishery management, restoration strategies and marine spatial planning."

  1966, and has been using similar sampling methods to the PISCO
  program to monitor kelp forests in the region since the 2004
  wide-scale monitoring effort of the Cooperative Research and
  Assessment of Nearshore Ecosystems (CRANE) Program. Researchers at
  Humboldt State University began monitoring sites in the north coast
  region in 2014 and 2015 using the PISCO sampling methodology. Data
  have been integrated across all four programs. To comprehensively and quantitatively characterize the ecological
  community and geological features at each kelp forest site, four
  different sampling methods are employed, all of which are conducted
  visually by SCUBA divers. Fish transects and benthic macroalgae and
  invertebrate transects overlap with, but are spatially distinct from
  one another. Surveys are conducted annually, during the summer or
  early fall. Typically, two to four sites inside a given MPA and two
  to four sites outside of the MPA are surveyed in a given year, with
  the number and shape of sites varying depending on habitat (e.g.
  onshore-offshore steepness of the reef) and longshore width of the

Witman; Robert W. Lamb,"Kelp forests provide important ecosystem services, yet coastal kelp communities are increasingly altered by anthropogenic impacts. Kelp forests in remote, offshore locations may provide an informative contrast due to reduced impacts from local stressors. We tested the hypothesis that shallow kelp assemblages (12-15 m depth) and associated fish and benthic communities in the coastal southwest Gulf of Maine (GOM) differed significantly from sites on Cashes Ledge, 145 km offshore by sampling five coastal and three offshore sites at 43.0 +/- 0.07° N latitude. Offshore sites on Cashes Ledge supported the greatest density (47.8 plants m-2) and standing crop biomass (5.5 kg m-2 fresh weight) of the foundation species Saccharina latissima kelp at this depth in the Western North Atlantic. Offshore densities of S. latissima were over 150 times greater than at coastal sites, with similar but lower magnitude trends for congeneric S. digitata. Despite these differences, S. latissima underwent a significant 36.2% decrease between 1987 and 2015 on Cashes Ledge, concurrent with a rapid warming of the GOM and invasion by the kelp-encrusting bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. In contrast to kelp, the invasive red alga Dasysiphonia japonica was significantly more abundant at coastal sites, suggesting light or dispersal limitation offshore. Spatial differences in fish abundance mirrored those of kelp, as the average biomass of all fish on Cashes Ledge was 305 times greater than at the coastal sites. Remote video censuses of cod (Gadus morhua), cunner (Tautaogolabrus adspersus), and pollock (Pollachius virens) corroborated these findings. Understory benthic communities also differed between regions, with greater abundance of sessile invertebrates offshore. Populations of kelp-consuming sea urchins Stronglyocentrotus droebachiensis were virtually absent from Cashes Ledge while small urchins were abundant onshore, suggesting recruitment limitation offshore. Despite widespread warming of the GOM since 1987, extraordinary spatial differences in the abundance of primary producers (kelp), consumers (cod) and benthic communities between coastal and offshore sites have persisted. The shallow kelp forest communities offshore on Cashes Ledge represent an oasis of unusually high kelp and fish abundance in the region, and as such, comprise a persistent abundance hotspot that is functionally significant for sustained biological productivity of offshore regions of the Gulf of Maine."

Yet, climate change may be altering the outcomes of top-down forcing in kelp forests, especially those located in regions that have rapidly warmed in recent decades, such as the Gulf of Maine. Here, using data collected annually from 30+ sites spanning >350 km of coastline, we explored the dynamics of Maine's kelp forests in the ~20 years after a fishery-induced elimination of sea urchin herbivores. Although forests (dominated by Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata) had broadly returned to Maine in the late 20th century, we found that forests in northeast Maine have since experienced slow but significant declines in kelp, and forest persistence in the northeast was juxtaposed by a rapid, widespread collapse in the southwest. Forests collapsed in the southwest apparently because ocean warming has – directly and indirectly – made this area inhospitable to kelp. Indeed, when modeling drivers of change using causal techniques from econometrics, we discovered that unusually high summer water temperatures the year prior, unusually high spring water temperatures, and high sea urchin densities each negatively impacted kelp abundance. Furthermore, the relative power and absolute impact of these drivers varied geographically. Our findings reveal that ocean warming is redefining the outcomes of top-down forcing in this system, whereby herbivore removal no longer predictably leads to a sustained dominance of kelp – the ecosystem's foundation – but instead has led to a waning dominance (northeast) or the rise of a novel phase state defined by ""turf"" algae (southwest). Such findings indicate that limiting climate change and managing for low herbivore abundances will be essential for preventing further loss of the vast forests that still exist in northeastern Maine. They also more broadly highlight that climate change is ""rewriting the rules"" of nature, and thus that ecological theory and practice must be revised to account for shifting species and processes."

Data collection was conducted in areas where WorldView-2 satellite coverage was planned from Calvert Island to McMullin Group. Data consists of point SHP file with field photos and species / density metrics. 
Field equipment:
A 2 x 2 meter quadrant was used in a variety of kelp beds in order to be representative of kelp beds observed on the central coast. 
A 2 meter quadrant was chosen because the WorldView-2 satellite data resolution is produced at 2 meters (multispectral).
Topcon GR5 survey grade GPS was used to collect spatial data. A DGPS mode was used to collect data soaking for 5-10 seconds providing < 10 cm X / Y accuracy.

Visual transect surveys were completed by SCUBA divers along the bottom of the kelp forest. The VRG dataset provided fish counts along 2m x 60m transects which were subsequently averaged for comparison with the PISCO dataset. The PISCO dataset provided mean counts along a 2m x 30m transect which were doubled before combining with the VRG data.  Fish that were not present in at least 5% of the trawls were removed from this analysis, resulting in a site by species matrix of 44 sites and 45 species.

MPAs in the NCC study region (NCCSR) were implemented on May 1, 2010. Baseline characterizations were conducted by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) between August and October of 2010 and 2011. Visual SCUBA surveys took place at sites within MPAs and at their associated reference sites (sites outside MPA) to establish quantitative baselines for measuring future MPA effects (i.e., changes in community structure due to MPA implementation). This particular map service focuses on PISCOs characterization of fish communities aimed at estimating fish densities and fish size distribution. Refer to the following link for specifics regarding PISCOs “fish survey design” and “fish sampling methodology”: http://www.piscoweb.org/research/science-by-discipline/ecosystem-monitoring/kelp-forest-monitoring/subtidal-sampling-protoco#FishSurvey.Surveys for baseline characterization of kelp forest communities focused on the following MPAs: Point Arena SMR; Sea Lion Cove SMCA; Saunders Reef SMCA; Del Mar SMR; Stewarts Point SMR/SMCA; and Salt Point SMCA. From Point Arena to Salt Point, 35 cells (fundamental sampling units) were sampled via fish transects (inside and outside of MPAs) using stratified sampling across shore and at various depths in the kelp forests (5m, 10m, 15m and 20m). Utilizing PISCOs GPS coordinates of the 35 study cells (points), and details from PISCOs methods (see link above), we created estimated footprints of the areas in which these transects were surveyed (the 35 fundamental sampling units). From there, we also estimated the aggregated site polygons (aggregate sampling units) that comprise either an MPA or an MPA reference site; this resulted in 12 new polygons that were representative of the kelp and shallow rock ecosystems surv"
