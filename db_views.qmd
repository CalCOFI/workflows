## Overview

These databaase views make common queries easier by consolidating related tables. A regular `VIEW` is executed every time it's called whereas a `MATERIALIZED VIEW` is cached and instantly available like a table.

By generating these views with this Quarto document, you'll see when it was last rendered with the "MODIFIED" date stamp and any other diagnostic information can be displayed as a versioned record in Github.

## `view_ctd_casts`

```{r}
# load latest dev version of calcofi4r from parent folder
devtools::load_all(here::here("../calcofi4r"))

# get database connection (con)
con <- cc_db_connect()

# list tables in db
dbListTables(con)

# preview tables used for input
tbl(con, "ctd_casts")

# preview tables used for input
tbl(con, "effort_grid")

# create view
dbSendQuery(
  con, 
  "DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS view_ctd_casts")
dbSendQuery(
  con,
  "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_ctd_casts AS
  SELECT 
    c.*,  
    g.sta_shore AS grid_shore, sta_pattern AS grid_pattern, sta_key AS grid_key, 
    g.sta_lin AS grid_lin, g.sta_pos AS grid_pos
  FROM ctd_casts AS c
  JOIN effort_grid AS g
  ON ST_Contains(g.geom, c.geom)")

tbl(con, "view_ctd_casts")
create_index(con, "view_ctd_casts", "cast_count", is_unique=T)
create_index(con, "view_ctd_casts", "geom", is_geom=T)
create_index(con, "view_ctd_casts", "quarter")
create_index(con, "view_ctd_casts", "date")
create_index(con, "view_ctd_casts", "grid_pattern")
create_index(con, "view_ctd_casts", "grid_shore")
